This was originally written in my first weeks at devCodeCamp. The objective was to create a game that would use six different sided dice. We had to come up with the idea, get that idea approved by the instructors, and then create the program.  At this point in the course, I was struggling understanding how functions really worked, but was going to give it my best shot regardless.  My idea was a bowling game that would take certain values that were "rolled" into account when deciding how many pins would be knocked down.  I wanted to the probabilities to line up with spares, splits, gutterballs, etc.  Given my current skill set, I spun myself into circles a lot, and didn't get a lot done.  

This iritated me.  I readdressed this repo not too long ago, and with the knowledge that I have now.  Using objects, functions and callbacks, I was able to create a console game that not only took into account each frame score, but also kept a running calculation of the score throughout the game.
